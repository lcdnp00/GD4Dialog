This is a tool to easily add and customize dialogue to your games in Godot 4.
I'll make it a custom node soon.
I am creating it for the sake of my current game project, but i want to make it versatile and easy to use for future projects.
The project is barely even starting, but the end goal is that you may easily add character sprites, background images and other fancy assets to add more flavor to dialogue in your game/visual novel.
Feel free to modify it for your own needs.
